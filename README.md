# MelanomaAI-Skin-Cancer-Detection
MelanomaAI Skin Cancer Detection is a machine learning project that classifies skin lesions as benign or malignant using CNN models. It analyzes RGB, grayscale, and augmented images, evaluating performance with accuracy, F1-score, and ROC curves. The optimized model aids early melanoma detection for accurate, reliable predictions.
